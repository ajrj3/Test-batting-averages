# Test-batting-averages
Test batting averages: home vs. away

Plots test cricket players away batting average against their home batting average:

1. Data collection - Beautiful Soup used to scrape data from ESPNcricinfo's database
2. Data analysis - pandas used for data wrangling and analysis
3. Data plotting - matplotlib used to generate final figure, which uses a heat map to show relative density of players relative to one another
